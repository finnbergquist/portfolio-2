### Description

This project was created as part of my journey to improve my skills in React. Each component in the `components` directory corresponds to a different part of the application. For example, `AboutPage` contains the files related to the "About" section of the portfolio, while `ProjectsPage` contains files related to displaying various projects.

- **`components/AboutPage`**: Contains styling and JavaScript for the About page.
- **`components/BackgroundVideo`**: Contains styling and JavaScript for background video elements.
- **`components/ContactPage`**: Contains styling and JavaScript for the Contact page.
- **`components/Header`**: Contains styling and JavaScript for the Header component.
- **`components/MainPage`**: Contains styling and JavaScript for the Main page of the portfolio.
- **`components/ProjectModule`**: Contains styling and JavaScript for individual project modules.
- **`components/ProjectsPage`**: Contains styling and JavaScript for the Projects page.

The project also includes directories for markdown files, photos, and videos used within the portfolio. The `App.js` file serves as the main entry point for the React application, and `App.test.js` contains tests for the application.

### Running the Project

To run the project in development mode, use:

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

This will open the app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

For deployment instructions, refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### Building the Project

To build the project for production, use:

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

This will create an optimized build of the application in the `build` directory.
