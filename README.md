- **`components/AboutPage`**
  - `AboutPage.css`: Contains styling for the About page.
  - `AboutPage.js`: Contains the JavaScript for the About page.

- **`components/BackgroundVideo`**
  - `BackgroundVideo.css`: Contains styling for background video elements.
  - `BackgroundVideo.js`: Contains the JavaScript for background video elements.

- **`components/ContactPage`**
  - `ContactPage.css`: Contains styling for the Contact page.
  - `ContactPage.js`: Contains the JavaScript for the Contact page.

- **`components/Header`**
  - `Header.css`: Contains styling for the Header component.
  - `Header.js`: Contains the JavaScript for the Header component.

- **`components/MainPage`**
  - `MainPage.css`: Contains styling for the Main page of the portfolio.
  - `MainPage.js`: Contains the JavaScript for the Main page of the portfolio.

- **`components/ProjectModule`**

  - `ProjectModule.js`: Contains the JavaScript for individual project modules.
